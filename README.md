# iQueue

**Got a hypothesis? Test it rigorously. No credentials required.**

-----

## Vision

**3+ billion people have smartphones.**  
**Millions have ideas that could be breakthroughs.**  
**No infrastructure to test them rigorously.**

**iQueue solves this.**

We provide the methodology, computation, and validation infrastructure to turn anyone’s hypothesis into research-grade results—from their phone.

No PhD required. No lab access needed. No institutional gatekeeping.

**Just:** Clear thinking + testable hypothesis + iQueue = Validated results.

-----

## The Problem

**Research capability is artificially scarce.**

To test a scientific hypothesis today, you need:

- University affiliation
- Credentials (PhD, postdoc, tenure track)
- Lab access and equipment
- Grant funding
- Years of training
- Institutional approval

**Result:** Breakthrough insights stay locked in people’s heads because they can’t access the infrastructure to test them.

**The roofing QC manager with an insight about information geometry?** Blocked.  
**The farmer with a novel approach to soil microbiome dynamics?** Blocked.  
**The mechanic who sees materials science differently?** Blocked.  
**The high school student with a better photosynthesis model?** Blocked.

**Not because their ideas are bad.**  
**Because the gates are closed.**

-----

## The Solution

**iQueue is research infrastructure for everyone.**

### What We Provide:

**1. Rigorous Methodology (Automated)**

- Research Assistant Charter-based quality gates
- Preregistration protocols (lock methodology before testing)
- Automated validation (G1-G6 compliance)
- Evidence hierarchy (E1-E5 levels)
- Productive skepticism built-in

**2. Computational Resources**

- Cloud simulation environments
- Pre-configured for multiple domains:
  - Biology (protein folding, molecular dynamics, cell systems)
  - Physics (particle interactions, field theory, cosmology)
  - Chemistry (reaction dynamics, materials properties)
  - Climate (atmospheric modeling, carbon cycles)
  - AI/ML (model testing, intrinsic properties)
- Auto-scaling based on demand
- No hardware required

**3. AI-Guided Formulation**

- Claude/GPT integration for hypothesis refinement
- Helps make ideas testable and falsifiable
- Guides through methodology requirements
- Suggests appropriate simulation approaches
- Asks failure mode questions (productive skepticism)

**4. Validation & Publishing**

- Automated quality gate checking
- Results validated against preregistration
- Full provenance capture (hashes, versions, parameters)
- DOI assignment for citable results
- GitHub-style repos for reproducibility
- **Negative results published** (they’re data too)

## How It Works

### User Journey:

**1. Submit Hypothesis**

```
User: "I think protein folding efficiency could be improved 
       if chloroplasts were arranged differently."

iQueue AI: "Let's make this testable. What specific arrangement 
            do you propose? What metric defines 'improved'?"
```

**2. Methodology Wizard**

```
Charter-based gates (automated):
✓ G1: Numeric thresholds defined?
✓ G2: Bounded scope (one claim)?
✓ G3: Operational definitions clear?
✓ G4: Success/failure criteria locked?
✓ G5: Negative controls specified?
✓ G6: Reproducibility parameters set?

AI guides user to satisfy each gate.
Can't proceed until all gates pass.
```

**3. Preregistration Lock**

```
Complete specification:
- Hypothesis (falsifiable claim)
- Methodology (how we'll test)
- Success criteria (what proves you right)
- Failure criteria (what proves you wrong)
- Negative controls (what validates the test)

Cryptographic hash generated.
Timestamp locked.
Methodology is now frozen.
```

**4. Queue Simulation**

```
Simulation queued on cloud infrastructure.
Progress updates in real-time.
Estimated completion time shown.
Can queue multiple simulations.
```

**5. Results & Validation**

```
Automated checks:
- Simulation ran correctly?
- Results meet preregistration criteria?
- Negative controls behaving as expected?
- Quality gates passed?

Output: PASS / FAIL / INCONCLUSIVE
Full provenance package generated.
```

**6. Publishing**

```
Validated result → Citable repository created
DOI assigned
Full reproducibility package
Share link, download data

Failed results also published.
(Negative results advance knowledge too.)
```

## Why This Works Now

**This wasn’t possible 5 years ago:**

**2019:**

- AI couldn’t guide hypothesis formulation
- Cloud compute too expensive
- Simulation tools not accessible
- No proven methodology for independent validation

**2026:**

- **AI can help non-experts formulate rigorous hypotheses** (GPT-4, Claude)
- **Cloud compute is cheap and scalable** (AWS, GCP, Azure)
- **Simulation tools are mature** (AlphaFold, molecular dynamics, physics engines)
- **Methodology proven** (Fold-Engine demonstrates rigorous black-box testing)

**The infrastructure exists. We’re assembling it.**

## Why This Matters

**String theory: 40 years, billions in funding, zero testable predictions.**

Meanwhile, brilliant people are shut out of research because:

- Wrong credentials
- Wrong institution
- Wrong pedigree
- Asked wrong questions

**Institutional gatekeeping wastes human potential.**

iQueue bypasses the gates.

### What Could Happen:

**When 3 billion people can test their ideas rigorously:**

- Breakthrough insights from unexpected places
- Novel approaches to unsolved problems
- Answers to questions we didn’t know to ask
- **Science advances faster because barriers are removed**

**The answer you’re looking for might exist right now** in someone’s mind.

**They just can’t test it.**

**iQueue fixes this.**

## Philosophy

### From the Founder:

> “I built 26 GitHub repositories from my iPhone. Developed a theoretical physics framework. Created research-grade methodologies. Orchestrated distributed AI teams. All without institutional backing.
> 
> If I can do this, anyone can.
> 
> The tools exist. The computational power exists. The AI assistance exists.
> 
> What’s missing is the infrastructure to make it accessible.
> 
> iQueue is that infrastructure.”

**Core Principles:**

1. **Credentials ≠ Capability** - Ideas should be judged on merit, not pedigree
1. **Rigor Without Gates** - Quality control doesn’t require institutional approval
1. **Negative Results Matter** - Failed experiments are data, not failures
1. **Reproducibility is Mandatory** - Every result includes full provenance
1. **Accessibility is Justice** - Research capability should be universal
